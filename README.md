## 📊 Growth Logic & Philosophies

```yaml
core_principles:
  - "No Vibe Coding": Prioritize conversion logic over superficial aesthetics.
  - "Security First": 12+ years of Ethical Hacking ensures growth is built on stable, non-vulnerable foundations.
  - "Direct Attribution": If it isn't tracked via CAPI/Server-side, it didn't happen.
  - "Local-First Ops": Heavy use of Raycast, MCPs, and Shell scripts to 10x output speed.
